# Statistical learning in multiclass classification

The chosen dataset can be found in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/vicsuperman/prediction-of-music-genre). The goal is predicting the music genre from this list: _electronic_, _anime_, _jazz_, _alternative_, _country_, _rap_, _blues_, _rock_, _classical_, _hip-hop_. But in this case only it is only employed *classical*, *electronic*, *hip-hop* and *jazz* to get clearer distinctions between these genres.

The full analysis is carried out in R , **code.R**, with the full explanations presented in **report.pdf**. The contents are:

* Missing data.
* Graphical analysis of the variables.
* Main characteristics of quantitative variables.
* Outliers.
* Dimension Reduction Techniques (PCA and ICA).
* Unsupervised classification.
* Supervised classification.

The original data as well as some preprocessed are stored in the folder **dataset**.
